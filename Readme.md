# natsws-react-fixture

Simple set of scripts to build a react environment that uses nats.ws:

Requires a nats-server to be installed.

- `npm test`

Should be greeted by a very not exciting "connected to localhost:9333" on the web browser.

- `npm stop` to stop the nats-server, ctrl+c the react process to stop it
